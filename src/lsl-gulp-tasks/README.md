# lsl-gulp-tasks

#### A set of common gulp tasks for frontend development

_For an example using these tasks, check out
[space-debris][space-debris]._

This project defines a collection of build tasks that are often useful
for frontend-based web apps. These build tasks use the
[gulp.js](http://http://gulpjs.com/) task management system.

Each gulp task has been split apart into its own file. This helps to
keep the system modular and maintainable.

For the most part, each task should be self-explanatory. If you are
unsure what a specific task is doing, refer to the documentation in the
[NPM registry](http://npmjs.org/) for the specific packages being used.
